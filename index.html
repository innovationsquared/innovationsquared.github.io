      <p id="pic-paragraph">1. There was a Master come
        unto the earth, born in
        the holy land of Indiana,
        raised in the mystical
        hills east of Fort Wayne.
        2. The Master learned of this
        world in the public schools of
        Indiana, and as he grew, in his trade as a mechanic
        of automobiles.
        3. But the Master had learnings
        from other lands and other
        schools, from other lives that
        he had lived. He remembered
        these, and remembering became
        wise and strong, so that others
        saw his strength and came
        to him for counsel.
        4. The Master believed that he
        had power to help himself
        and all mankind, and as he
        believed so it was for him,
        so that others saw his
        power and came to him to be healed of their troubles
        and their many diseases.
        5. The Master believed that it
        is well for any man to
        think upon himself as a son
        of God, and as he believed,
        so it was, and the
        shops and garages where he
        worked became crowded and
        jammed with those who sought
        his learning and his touch,
        and the streets outside
        with those who longed only
        that the shadow of his
        passing might fall upon them,
        and change their lives.
        6. It came to pass, because
        of the crowds, that the
        several foremen and shop
        managers bid the Master
        leave his tools and go
        his way, for so tightly
        was he thronged that neither
        he nor other mechanics had
        room to work upon the
        automobiles.
        7. So it was that he went
        into the countryside, and
        people following began to call
        him Messiah, and worker of
        miracles; and as they believed,
        it was so. 8. If a storm passed as
        he spoke, not a raindrop
        touched a listener’s head;
        the last of the multitude
        heard his words as clearly
        as the first, no matter
        lightning nor thunder in
        the sky about. And always
        he spoke to them in parables.
        9. And he said unto them,
        “within each of us lies the
        power of our consent to health
        and to sickness, to riches
        and to poverty, to freedom
        and to slavery. It is we
        who control these, and
        not another.” 10. A mill-man spoke and said,
        “Easy words for you, Master,
        for you are guided as we
        are not, and need not toil
        as we toil. A man has to
        work for his living in
        this world.”
        11. The Master answered and said,
        “Once there lived a village
        of creatures along the bottom
        of a great crystal river.
        12. “The current of the river
        swept silently over them
        all - young and old, rich
        and poor, good and evil,
        the current going its own way, knowing only its own
        crystal self.
        13. “Each creature in its own
        manner clung tighty to the
        twigs and rocks of the river
        bottom, for clinging was their
        way of life, and resisting
        the current what each had
        learned from birth.
        14. “But one creature said at
        last, ‘I am tired of clinging.
        Though I cannot see it
        with my eyes, I trust that
        the current knows where it is
        going. I shall let go, and
        let it take me where it will. Clinging, I shall die
        of boredom.’
        15. “The other creatures laughed and
        said, ‘Fool! Let go, and that
        current you worship will throw
        you tumbled and smashed
        across the rocks, and you
        will die quicker than boredom!’
        16. “But the one heeded them
        not, and taking a breath
        did let go, and at once
        was tumbled and smashed by
        the current across the rocks.
        17. “Yet in time, as the creature
        refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from
        the bottom, and he was bruised
        and hurt no more.
        18. “And the creatures downstream, to
        whom he was a stranger,
        cried, ‘See a miracle! A creature
        like ourselves, yet he flies!
        See the Messiah, come to save
        us all!’
        19. “And the one carried in
        the current said, ‘I am
        no more Messiah than you.
        The river delights to lift
        us free, if only we dare
        let go. Our true work is
        this voyage, this adventure.’ 20. “But they cried the more,
        ‘Saviour!’ all the while clinging
        to the rocks, and when they
        looked again he was gone, and
        they were left alone making
        legends of a Saviour.”
        21. And it came to pass when
        he saw that the multitude
        thronged him the more day on
        day, tighter and closer and
        fiercer than ever they had,
        when he saw that they pressed
        him to heal them without rest,
        and feed them always with
        his miracles, to learn for them
        and to live their lives, he
        went alone that day unto a hilltop apart, and there he prayed.
        22. And he said in his heart,
        Infinite Radian Is, if it
        be thy will, let this cup
        pass from me, let me lay
        aside this impossible task.
        I cannot live the life
        of one other soul, yet ten
        thousand cry to me for life.
        I’m sorry I allowed it all
        to happen. If it be thy
        will, let me go back to my
        engines and my tools and
        let me live as other men.
        23. And a voice spoke to him on
        the hilltop, a voice neither male nor female, loud nor
        soft, a voice infinitely kind.
        And the voice said unto him,
        “Not my will, but thine be
        done. For what is thy will
        is mine for thee. Go thy
        way as other men, and
        be thou happy on the earth.”
        24. And hearing, the Master was
        glad, and gave thanks, and came
        down from the hilltop humming
        a little mechanic’s song.
        And when the throng pressed
        him with its woes, beseeching
        him to heal for it and learn
        for it and feed it nonstop
        from his understanding and to entertain it with his wonders,
        he smiled upon the multitude
        and said pleasantly unto them,
        “I quit.”
        25. For a moment the multitude
        was stricken dumb with
        astonishment.
        26. And he said unto them,
        “If a man told God that he
        wanted most of all to help the
        suffering world, no matter the
        price to himself, and God
        answered and told him what he
        must do, should the man do
        as he is told?” 27. “Of course, Master!” cried the
        many. “It should be pleasure
        for him to suffer the
        tortures of hell itself, should
        God ask for it!”
        28. “No matter what those tortures,
        nor how difficult the task?”
        29. “Honor to be hanged, glory
        to be nailed to a tree
        and burned, if so be that
        God has asked,” said they.
        30. “And what would you do,”
        the Master said unto the
        multitude, “if God spoke directly
        to your face and said,
        ‘I COMMAND THAT YOU BE
        HAPPY IN THE WORLD, AS
        LONG AS YOU LIVE.’ What
        would you do then?”
        31. And the multitude was silent,
        not a voice, not a sound
        was heard upon the hillsides,
        across the valleys where
        they stood.
        32. And the Master said unto
        the silence, “In the path
        of our happiness shall we
        find the learning for which
        we have chosen this lifetime.
        So it is that I have
        learned this day, and choose to leave you now
        to walk your own path,
        as you please.”
        33. And he went his way
        through the crowds and
        left them, and he
        returned to the everyday
        world of men and machines. 1. There was a Master come
        unto the earth, born in
        the holy land of Indiana,
        raised in the mystical

        room to work upon the
        automobiles.
        7. So it was that he went
        into the countryside, and
        people following began to call
        him Messiah, and worker of
        miracles; and as they believed,
        it was so. 8. If a storm passed as
        he spoke, not a raindrop
        touched a listener’s head;
        the last of the multitude
        heard his words as clearly
        as the first, no matter
        lightning nor thunder in
        the sky about. And always
        he spoke to them in parables.
        9. And he said unto them,
        “within each of us lies the
        power of our consent to health
        and to sickness, to riches
        and to poverty, to freedom
        and to slavery. It is we
        who control these, and
        not another.” 10. A mill-man spoke and said,
        “Easy words for you, Master,
        for you are guided as we
        are not, and need not toil
        as we toil. A man has to
        work for his living in
        this world.”
        11. The Master answered and said,
        “Once there lived a village
        of creatures along the bottom
        of a great crystal river.
        12. “The current of the river
        swept silently over them
        all - young and old, rich
        and poor, good and evil,
        the current going its own way, knowing only its own
        crystal self.
        13. “Each creature in its own
        manner clung tighty to the
        twigs and rocks of the river
        bottom, for clinging was their
        way of life, and resisting
        the current what each had
        learned from birth.
        14. “But one creature said at
        last, ‘I am tired of clinging.
        Though I cannot see it
        with my eyes, I trust that
        the current knows where it is
        going. I shall let go, and
        let it take me where it will. Clinging, I shall die
        of boredom.’
        15. “The other creatures laughed and
        said, ‘Fool! Let go, and that
        current you worship will throw
        you tumbled and smashed
        across the rocks, and you
        will die quicker than boredom!’
        16. “But the one heeded them
        not, and taking a breath
        did let go, and at once
        was tumbled and smashed by
        the current across the rocks.
        17. “Yet in time, as the creature
        refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from
        the bottom, and he was bruised
        and hurt no more.
        18. “And the creatures downstream, to
        whom he was a stranger,
        cried, ‘See a miracle! A creature
        like ourselves, yet he flies!
        See the Messiah, come to save
        us all!’
        19. “And the one carried in
        the current said, ‘I am
        no more Messiah than you.
        The river delights to lift
        us free, if only we dare
        let go. Our true work is
        this voyage, this adventure.’ 20. “But they cried the more,
        ‘Saviour!’ all the while clinging
        to the rocks, and when they
        looked again he was gone, and
        they were left alone making
        legends of a Saviour.”
        21. And it came to pass when
        he saw that the multitude
        thronged him the more day on
        day, </p>
